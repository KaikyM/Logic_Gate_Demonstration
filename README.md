# Logic Gate Demonstration

## Contextualization
I decided to recreate the basic logic gates in Tinkercad using simple electronics concepts.
The red lines represent binary 1, the black lines represent binary 0, and the grey lines are used solely to enhance the contrast for better visibility in the binary operation

## Logic Gates
### Buffer
This is a logic buffer that allows the passage of binary signals, both 0 and 1. I added a multimeter to make it more visible how the system behaves with the button

height = "300" width = "430">

### NOT
Additionally, in this case, the Blue LED represents the negated binary 1 signal, and the Green LED represents the negated binary 0 signal
